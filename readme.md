## What is this?

This utility lets you find one or many files downwards.

## When should I use this?

You can use this utility if you want to find files in, say, a folder.
One example is all markdown files.
If you instead want to find files upwards, such as config files, you can use
[`vfile-find-up`][vfile-find-up].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-find-down
```

## Use

```js
import {findDown} from 'vfile-find-down'

console.log(await findDown('.md'))
```

Yields:

```js
[ VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: [ '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-find-down/readme.md' ],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-find-down' } ]
```

## API

This package exports the identifiers `findDown`, `findDownOne`, `INCLUDE`,
`SKIP`, and `BREAK`.
There is no default export.

### `findDown(tests[, paths][, callback])`

Search for `tests` downwards.
Calls callback with either an error or an array of files passing `tests`, or
returns them as a promise if no `callback` is passed.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: files are not read (their `value` is not populated).

##### Signatures

*   `(tests: Tests, paths?: string|Array<string>, callback: Callback): void`
*   `(tests: Tests, paths?: string|Array<string>): Promise<Array<VFile>>`

##### Parameters

###### `tests`

Things to search for (`string|Function|Array<Tests>`).

If an array is passed in, any test must match a given file for it to be
included.

If a `string` is passed in, the `basename` or `extname` of files must match it
for them to be included (and hidden directories and `node_modules` will not be
searched).

Otherwise, they must be [`Assert`][assert].

###### `paths`

Place or places to search from (`Array<string>` or `string`, default:
`process.cwd()`).

###### `callback`

Function called with all matching files (`function cb(error[, files])`).

### `findDownOne(tests[, paths][, callback])`

Like `findDown`, but either calls `callback` with the first found file or
`null`, or returns a promise that resolved to a file or `null`.

### `function assert(file, stats)`

Check whether a file should be included.
Called with a [vfile][] and a [stats][] object.

###### Returns

*   `true` or `INCLUDE` â€” include the file in the results
*   `SKIP` â€” do not search inside this directory
*   `BREAK` â€” stop searching for files
*   anything else is ignored: files are neither included nor skipped

The different flags can be combined by using the pipe operator:
`INCLUDE | SKIP`.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types `Assert` and `Test`.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
